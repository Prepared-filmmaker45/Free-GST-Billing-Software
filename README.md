## Why FreeGSTBill?

Most billing software stores your data on their servers, charges you monthly, and locks you in. FreeGSTBill is different:

- **Your data never leaves your computer** — Everything is stored as local JSON files in a `data/` folder on your machine. No cloud, no third-party servers, no analytics, no tracking. Your invoices, client details, GSTIN, bank info — all stays with you. Period.
- **GST compliance on autopilot** — Just create invoices normally. FreeGSTBill auto-generates your GSTR-1 (B2B + B2C), GSTR-3B summary, HSN reports, and Document Summary. When filing day comes, your data is ready — download CSVs, follow the built-in step-by-step filing guide, and you're done. No CA needed for basic filing.
- **Works without internet** — Once installed, the entire app runs on localhost. No internet required to create invoices, generate PDFs, or view reports. Only Google Drive backup (optional) needs connectivity.
- **Install once, use forever** — No monthly fees. No "free tier" limits. No premium upsell. MIT licensed. You own the software.
- **Install as a desktop app (PWA)** — Works like a native Windows/Mac app. One-click install from your browser. Opens instantly, no browser tabs needed.

## Key Highlights

- **100% Local & Private** — Runs on localhost. All data stored as files on your machine. Zero cloud dependency.
- **Multi-Currency** — Bill in INR, USD, EUR, GBP, AUD, CAD, SGD, AED with proper formatting and amount-in-words.
- **GST Compliant** — Auto CGST/SGST (intra-state) and IGST (inter-state) calculation.
- **GST Filing Ready** — GSTR-1, GSTR-3B summaries, HSN reports, CSV export, step-by-step filing guide. All compliance data auto-generated from your invoices.
- **Expense Tracker + ITC** — Track expenses with GST, auto-calculate Input Tax Credit, feeds into GSTR-3B and P&L.
- **Professional PDFs** — Download or auto-upload to Google Drive.
- **Dark Mode** — Full dark theme support.

## Before You Install — What You Should Know

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| **Where does my data go?** | Nowhere. It stays in a `data/` folder on your computer as plain JSON files. No server, no cloud, no database. |
| **Can anyone access my invoices?** | No. The app runs on `localhost` (your machine only). It's not accessible from the internet or other computers on your network. |
| **What happens if I uninstall?** | Your `data/` folder remains untouched. Reinstall anytime and everything is still there. You can also export a full JSON backup from Settings. |
| **Do I need internet?** | Only for the first install (`npm install`). After that, everything works offline — invoicing, PDF generation, reports, everything. |
| **Will it handle my GST compliance?** | Yes. Create invoices normally and FreeGSTBill auto-generates: GSTR-1 B2B & B2C reports, GSTR-3B summary with ITC from expenses, HSN summary, Document Summary (Table 13), and CSV exports ready for the GST portal. It even has a step-by-step filing guide. |
| **Is it really free?** | Yes. MIT licensed. No premium tier, no ads, no tracking, no signup wall. Fork it, modify it, use it commercially — no restrictions. |

## Quick Start

**Requires:** [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18+

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IamRamgarhia/freegstbill.git
cd freegstbill
npm install

# Windows
npm run dev:win

# macOS / Linux
npm run dev
```

Opens at **http://localhost:5173** — API server runs on port 3001.

### First-Time Setup
1. **Settings** → fill business profile (name, GSTIN, PAN, bank details)
2. Upload logo & signature (optional)
3. Add terms templates you reuse
4. **New Invoice** → start billing
5. Create a few invoices → go to **Reports** → see your GSTR-1, GSTR-3B, HSN data auto-generated

### Production
```bash
npm run build && npm start
```
Serves from port 3001.

### Install as Desktop App (PWA)

FreeGSTBill can be installed as a standalone desktop app — no browser tab needed.

**How to install:**
1. Open `http://localhost:5173` (dev) or `http://localhost:3001` (production) in **Chrome** or **Edge**
2. Look for the **install icon** (⊕) in the address bar (right side)
3. Click it → **Install**
4. The app opens in its own window — works like a native desktop app

**How to verify PWA is working:**
1. After installing, close the browser completely
2. Open the app from your Start Menu / Desktop shortcut
3. It should open in its own window (no browser UI)
4. Disconnect from internet → create an invoice → generate PDF — everything should work
5. Check Chrome DevTools → Application → Service Workers → should show "activated and running"

**To uninstall:** Right-click the app title bar → "Uninstall FreeGSTBill", or go to `chrome://apps` and remove it.

> **Note:** The PWA caches all frontend assets. The backend server (`node server.js`) still needs to be running for data to save. For a fully portable setup, use the provided `.bat` / `.vbs` launchers on Windows.
